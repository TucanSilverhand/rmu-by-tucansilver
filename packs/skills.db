{"name":"Riding","type":"skill","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","system":{"description":"Riding includes the ability to stay on the mount safely as well as controlling the mount. Characters who lack any riding skill will struggle just to remain seated on an animal when it is moving (an unskilled rider can perform no actions other than perception and conversation while his mount is in motion). The animal will need to be led by someone else, or it will go where it pleases, as the unskilled rider has no control.\n\nHorses are herd animals, however, and if a mounted group is in motion, a horse not being led with an unskilled rider will follow the \"herd\" until spooked or threatened, at which point it will flee (following the group if they all flee, or in the direction away from what scared it if not).\n\nIf the mount moves at faster than a walk, an unskilled rider will need to at least partially succeed on a riding maneuver (at the usual -25 penalty for 0 ranks) every round to avoid being thrown.\n\nFor complex riding maneuvers or controlling the mount in stressful situations, a riding maneuver is required, with a modifier of half the movement penalty as shown in Table 5-3 in Chapter 5. All other Maneuvers and actions (like spell casting or attacks) made while riding are subject to the full penalty due to the pace of the mount (Table 5-3), which may be reduced with the Mounted Combat skill. All maneuvers that require the mount to back up are at an additional -20.\nSpecializations: Each specific type of animal or creature that can be ridden. \n","stats":"pr","statsBonus":0,"totalRanks":0,"rankBonus":0,"profBonus":0,"specBonus":0,"totalBonus":0,"profBonusBool":false,"knackBonusBool":false,"skillCategory":"animal"},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.S61qhX1L2jRjJMMQ"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"rmu-by-tucansilver","systemVersion":"0.0.2","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1670865929738,"modifiedTime":1670866242513,"lastModifiedBy":"OTTzLtK6fDhzWUz6"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"OTTzLtK6fDhzWUz6":3},"_id":"wAmsqgfSyzUp9K40"}
